The printed output shows that upon every execution of the program two processes are run, a parent and a child. The PIDs both processes are consecutive, because the child is created almost instantaneously and no other processes have been created in this time. Further, between consecutive executions, the PID of the next parent and previous child are consecutive as well for a similar reason.
